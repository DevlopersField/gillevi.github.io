I have been working in Software and Algorithms engineering for the past 15 years. I'm particularly interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, and also worked on Natural Language processing, Data Science and Medical imaging. I try to keep a "healthy mix" of Academia and Industy, 

particularly in the domains of Deep/Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Data Science and Medical Imaging, in roles ranging from hands-on individual contributor to tech lead and people manager, leading projects from research to production.

I have been working in software and algorithms engineering for the past 10+ years, I'm particularly interested in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (and the various methods and applications in which they are combined). I published several papers in those fields and in recent years been mostly reviewing (Neurips, ICLR, CVPR, I/ECCV... you name it), keeping up to date with DL/CV research while working in the industry develping and delivering AI products.
